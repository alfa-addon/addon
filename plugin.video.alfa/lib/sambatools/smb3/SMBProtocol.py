        Create a new SMBProtocolFactory instance. You will pass this instance to *reactor.connectTCP()* which will then instantiate the TCP connection to the remote SMB/CIFS server.

        Some newer server installations might also support Direct hosting of SMB over TCP/IP; for these servers, the default TCP port is 445.

                                    The choice of NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 is configured on the remote server, and there is no mechanism to auto-detect which algorithm has been configured.
                                    Hence, we can only "guess" or try both algorithms.
                                    On Sambda, Windows Vista and Windows 7, NTLMv2 is enabled by default. On Windows XP, we can use NTLMv1 before NTLMv2.

        :param boolean is_direct_tcp: Controls whether the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (is_direct_tcp=False) or the newer Direct hosting of SMB over TCP/IP (is_direct_tcp=True) will be used for the communication.
                                      The default parameter is False which will use NetBIOS over TCP/IP for wider compatibility (TCP port: 139).
